Recursion:
a function callingg itself
there are two types of recursion
1.base case: the base case is a condoition that the program will stop.
            *if there is no base case the program will continously runs at infinite recursion.
2.recursive case: function calls itself with a smaller input.
how function calls work in languages:
*while the functoion is not finished executing it will remain in stack
*when a function finishes executing it is removed from the stack and  the flow of program is restored to where the function was called.
why recursion:
*it helps us in solving bigger/complex problems in a simple way.
*you can convert recursion solution into iteration & vice versa.
*1.identify the base case
 2.identifyy what changes in each call.
 3.use a loop instead of function calls.
 4.use a stack manually to simulate recursion.
recursion uses call stack memory.
tooo many calls it takes over space,in iteration the space is low .
*space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls.
*it helps in breaking dowwn bigger problems into smaller problems.
example : find the nth fibonacci number?
solution : public class Fibonacci {
              public static int fib(int n){
                 if(n <= 1)
                   return n;
                  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
              }
             public static void main(string[]args){
               System.out.println(fib(6));
}
}
